# 2026_C_AV_HARDWARE
Repository containing PCBs files of FH2 Avionics

## Guidelines
This repository should be used to share your hardware project files with other members of the team.
Add your project root folder to the indexing and create commits with tags to track versioning of your PCB as you make progress in the design.
Create a tagged release for each major version of your PCB that enters production.
As the repository holds all the AV boards CAD files, you should prefix the tag with the name of your subfolder project.
Take care to preserve tags and respective folders of other members.
